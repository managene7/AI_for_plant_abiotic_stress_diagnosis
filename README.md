# Machine Learning-Based Discrimination of Abiotic Stresses Using Large-Scale Plant Transcriptomic Metadata

## Abstract
Abiotic stress is a primary constraint on global crop productivity, reducing potential yields by up to 70%. While advanced sensing and imaging technologies can detect physiological decline, they often fail to discriminate among specific stressor types, a critical requirement for precise agricultural management. Transcriptomic profiling offers a high-dimensional solution to this diagnostic bottleneck, given the rapid and sensitive shifts in gene expression that occur upon stress onset. In this study, we developed a robust machine learning framework that can identify and distinguish among four major abiotic stressors: salt, cold, heat, and drought. Using a curated metadata collection of 1,243 Arabidopsis leaf transcriptomes from public databases, we identified 320 stress-specific marker genes by differential expression and confirmed their functions using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. A single-layer perceptron was trained on these features using five-fold cross-validation. The model achieved a macro-average F1-score of 0.90 and an overall accuracy of 91% during cross-validation, with 93% accuracy on an independent test set. Furthermore, the model demonstrated the capacity to generalize to multi-stress conditions, successfully identifying both heat and salt signatures in combinatorial treatment samples. Our results provide proof of concept for the first transcriptomic-based diagnostic tool capable of discriminating among abiotic stressors. This approach offers a foundation for high-confidence stress labeling in AI-driven crop management and provides a quantitative molecular framework for precision breeding under global climate change.
